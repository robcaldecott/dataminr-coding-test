# Dataminr React Coding Test

This example uses `vite` and `vitest` as an alternative to
`create-react-app` and `jest` for fewer dependencies and
better performance.

First install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To run the app:

```
npm run dev
```

To run the tests:

```
npm test run
```

**Industry Font**

Note that although the Industry font is available on Adobe Fonts,
after logging in it states it is only available if I have a
Creative Cloud license. Hence I have used Roboto instead.
